Daddy, do you miss the sea? Well, sometimes. It is Grandad Dog, Grandpa Pig and Grumpy Rabbit. Hello? Can Captain Dog come out to play? What? We are going on a fishing trip. On a boat? On the sea! OK, let's go! But Daddy, you said you'd never get on a boat again. Oh, yes. So I did. OK, bye-bye! Bye!
